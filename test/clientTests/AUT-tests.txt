Implement the library of Application Under Test - testing here.
This is where all feature, regression and smoke testing should be created.
Sub-folders such as:
Test data
Page data
Assertion data
Results data
Locators (CSS/Xpath/ETC...)
Reports data
Keyword definitions (BDD/CSV/ETC...)
Test definitions (BDD/CSV/ETC...)
DevOps testing verticals definitions

All should be organized and placed under this folder.
